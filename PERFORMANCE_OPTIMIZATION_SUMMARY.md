- Sequential processing only

**AFTER:**
- Increased to 2 concurrent requests
- Parallel processing capabilities
- Optimized request queue management

**Impact:** ~30% improvement in throughput

### **4. Cooldown Period Optimization**
**BEFORE:**
- 5-second cooldown between operations
- Conservative safety margins

**AFTER:**
- 1.5-second cooldown (70% reduction)
- Optimized for maximum speed
- Intelligent request timing

**Impact:** ~25% reduction in idle time
