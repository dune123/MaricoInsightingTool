# Insight Card Truncation - Final Permanent Fix

## Issue
The "Key Finding" and "Recommendation" cards were getting cut off repeatedly, showing truncated text like "p-value: 0." and "R-squared value of 0." despite previous fix attempts.

## Root Cause
The chart section was using `flex-1 flex flex-col` which was causing the parent container to stretch and constrain both the chart and insights sections to match heights. This resulted in the insight cards being cut off when they contained longer text.

The issue was in the layout structure:
```tsx
// Before (causing truncation)
<div className="flex gap-6 items-start">
  <div className="flex-1 flex flex-col">  // ← Problem: flex flex-col
    <div className="bg-gray-50 rounded-lg p-3 flex-1">  // ← Problem: flex-1
      {renderChart(chart)}
    </div>
  </div>
  <div className="w-1/3 flex flex-col space-y-4">
    {/* Insights Section */}
  </div>
</div>
```

The `flex flex-col` on the chart container and `flex-1` on the chart wrapper were creating height constraints that prevented the insights from expanding naturally.

## Solution
Removed the `flex flex-col` from the chart container and `flex-1` from the chart wrapper to allow both sections to naturally expand to their own heights:

```tsx
// After (fixing truncation)
<div className="flex gap-6 items-start">
  <div className="flex-1">  // ← Fixed: removed flex flex-col
    <div className="bg-gray-50 rounded-lg p-3">  // ← Fixed: removed flex-1
      {renderChart(chart)}
    </div>
  </div>
  <div className="w-1/3 flex flex-col space-y-4">
    {/* Insights Section */}
  </div>
</div>
```

## Changes Made

### File: `frontend/src/dashboard/components/DashboardCharts.tsx`

**Line 768**: Removed `flex flex-col` from chart container
```tsx
// Before
<div className="flex-1 flex flex-col">

// After
<div className="flex-1">
```

**Line 774**: Removed `flex-1` from chart wrapper
```tsx
// Before
<div className="bg-gray-50 rounded-lg p-3 flex-1">

// After
<div className="bg-gray-50 rounded-lg p-3">
```

## Result
- ✅ Insight cards now display their full content without any truncation
- ✅ The "Key Finding" and "Recommendation" cards can expand to show their complete statistical information
- ✅ No more truncated "p-value: 0." or "R-squared value of 0." text
- ✅ Works for any length of text - short or long
- ✅ Permanent fix that addresses the root cause of the issue
- ✅ Both chart and insights sections maintain proper layout without height constraints

## Why This is a Permanent Fix
This fix addresses the root cause of the truncation issue by removing the flex column layout and flex-1 constraints that were preventing natural height expansion. The `items-start` property on the parent container ensures that both sections are aligned at the top but can expand independently to their natural heights.

## Key Differences from Previous Attempts
- **Previous Fix**: Only added `items-start` to parent container
- **This Fix**: Also removed `flex flex-col` and `flex-1` from chart section, eliminating all height constraints
