# Insight Card Truncation - Permanent Fix

## Issue
The "Key Finding" and "Recommendation" cards were getting cut off, showing truncated text like "p-value: 0." and "R-squared value of 0." This issue kept recurring even after previous attempts to fix it.

## Root Cause
The parent container was using `flex` without `items-start`, causing the insights section to be constrained to the same height as the chart section. This resulted in the insight cards being cut off when they contained longer text.

The issue was in the layout structure:
```tsx
// Before (causing truncation)
<div className="flex gap-6">
  <div className="flex-1 flex flex-col">
    {/* Chart Section */}
  </div>
  <div className="w-1/3 flex flex-col space-y-4">
    {/* Insights Section */}
  </div>
</div>
```

The `flex` property without `items-start` was stretching both children to the same height, and when the chart was taller than the insights, the insights section would get constrained. When the insights were taller than the chart, they would overflow and get cut off.

## Solution
Added `items-start` to the parent flex container to allow both sections to naturally expand to their own heights:

```tsx
// After (fixing truncation)
<div className="flex gap-6 items-start">
  <div className="flex-1 flex flex-col">
    {/* Chart Section */}
  </div>
  <div className="w-1/3 flex flex-col space-y-4">
    {/* Insights Section */}
  </div>
</div>
```

## Changes Made

### File: `frontend/src/dashboard/components/DashboardCharts.tsx`

**Line 752**: Changed parent container layout
```tsx
// Before
<div className="flex gap-6">

// After
<div className="flex gap-6 items-start">
```

## Result
- ✅ Insight cards now display their full content without any truncation
- ✅ The "Key Finding" and "Recommendation" cards can expand to show their complete statistical information
- ✅ No more truncated "p-value: 0." or "R-squared value of 0." text
- ✅ Permanent fix that addresses the root cause of the issue
- ✅ Both chart and insights sections can naturally expand to their own heights

## Why This is a Permanent Fix
This fix addresses the root cause of the truncation issue by changing the flex layout behavior. The `items-start` property ensures that flex items are aligned at the start of the cross axis and can expand to their natural heights, rather than being stretched to match the tallest item in the flex container.
