BRANDBLOOM INSIGHTS - MODULAR FASTAPI APPLICATION
========================================

Purpose: Lightweight FastAPI application entry point with modular architecture

Description:
This is the main FastAPI application file for BrandBloom Insights, completely refactored
to use a modular architecture. The file now focuses solely on application configuration,
middleware setup, route registration, and server initialization. All business logic,
data processing, and API endpoints have been extracted into focused modules.

Key Functionality:
- FastAPI application initialization and configuration
- CORS middleware setup for frontend integration
- Modular route registration from organized route modules
- Exception handling and error responses
- Application lifecycle event management
- Clean separation of concerns with minimal code

Modular Architecture:
- app/core/config.py: Centralized configuration management
- app/models/: Data models and type definitions
- app/services/: Business logic and service layer
- app/utils/: Utility functions and helpers
- app/routes/: API endpoint route modules

Benefits:
- Single responsibility principle: Each module has one clear purpose
- Maintainability: Easy to locate and modify specific functionality
- Testability: Individual modules can be tested in isolation
- Scalability: New features can be added as separate modules
- Clean code: Main file is now under 100 lines as requested

Dependencies:
- FastAPI for web framework
- uvicorn for ASGI server
- All business logic imported from modular components

Used by:
- Uvicorn server for application hosting
- Frontend React application for API communication
- Development and production deployment environments
