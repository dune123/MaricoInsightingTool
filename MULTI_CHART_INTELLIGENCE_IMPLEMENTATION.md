## 🎯 Key Features Implemented

### **1. Intelligent Query Classification**
The system now automatically classifies user queries into three categories:

#### **SPECIFIC Queries** → 1 Chart
**Patterns detected:**
- "X vs Y"
- "correlation between A and B"
- "pie chart of Z"
- "show me X and Y"

**Examples:**
- ✅ "Show me lead time vs revenue generated"
- ✅ "Pie chart of product type vs revenue"
- ✅ "Correlation between marketing spend and sales"

**Result:** Generates 1 focused chart addressing the specific request.

---

#### **GENERAL Queries** → TOP 5 Charts (Ranked)
**Patterns detected:**
- "what affects X"
- "factors affecting Y"
- "drivers of Z"
- "top factors for A"
- "what influences B"

**Examples:**
- ✅ "What affects revenue generated?"
- ✅ "Show me factors affecting sales performance"
- ✅ "What are the drivers of customer satisfaction?"

**Result:** Generates 5 charts ranked by correlation strength with:
- Ranking (#1 to #5) in title and description
- Exact correlation value (r = ±0.XX)
- Statistical significance (p-value)
- Business impact with quantified numbers
- Actionable recommendations

---

#### **EXPLORATORY Queries** → 3-4 Diverse Charts
**Patterns detected:**
- "insights on X"
- "analyze Y"
- "overview of Z"
- "patterns in A"

**Examples:**
- ✅ "Give me insights on our sales data"
- ✅ "Analyze the performance trends"
- ✅ "Show me an overview of the dataset"

**Result:** Generates 3-4 diverse charts showing different aspects with mixed chart types.
