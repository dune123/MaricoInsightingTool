## Critical Issues Resolved

### Backend Validation Error (422 Unprocessable Content) - ‚úÖ FIXED
**Issue**: The backend was rejecting NON_MMM analysis creation with a 422 validation error because the Pydantic model only accepted "MMM" or "Fresh Analysis" as valid analysis types.

**Root Cause**: 
- Backend model validation pattern: `^(MMM|Fresh Analysis)$`
- Frontend was sending: `"NON_MMM"`
- Result: Validation failure and 422 error

**Solution Implemented**:
1. **Updated Backend Model**: Modified `CreateAnalysisRequest` and `BrandAnalysis` models to accept "NON_MMM"
2. **Updated Validation Pattern**: Changed from `^(MMM|Fresh Analysis)$` to `^(MMM|Fresh Analysis|NON_MMM)$`
3. **Updated Documentation**: Updated API documentation and route descriptions to include NON_MMM support

**Files Modified**:
- `../backend/python/app/models/analysis_models.py` - Updated validation patterns
- `../backend/python/app/routes/analysis_routes.py` - Updated documentation
- `../backend/python/BACKEND_Python_DOCUMENTATION.mdc` - Updated analysis types
