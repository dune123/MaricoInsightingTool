# Vercel Deployment Guide

## Current Status
Your Node.js backend is deployed at: https://marico-insighting-tool-wkji.vercel.app/

## Issues Found
- ❌ File system operations not supported in Vercel serverless
- ❌ Directory creation fails in serverless environment
- ❌ File upload/processing not possible

## Solution Implemented
Created Vercel-compatible versions of your backend files:

### New Files Created:
1. `backend/nodejs/server-vercel.js` - Vercel-compatible server
2. `backend/nodejs/routes/fileRoutes-vercel.js` - Disabled file operations
3. `backend/nodejs/routes/filterRoutes-vercel.js` - Disabled file operations
4. `backend/nodejs/routes/brandRoutes-vercel.js` - Disabled file operations
5. `backend/nodejs/routes/metadataRoutes-vercel.js` - Disabled file operations
6. `backend/nodejs/routes/nonmmmRoutes-vercel.js` - Disabled file operations
7. `vercel.json` - Updated Vercel configuration

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Redeploy with Vercel-Compatible Code
```bash
# Commit the new files
git add .
git commit -m "Add Vercel-compatible backend files"
git push

# Redeploy to Vercel
vercel --prod
```

### Option 2: Deploy to Railway (Recommended for File Operations)
Railway supports persistent file storage and is better for your backend needs.

```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login to Railway
railway login

# Deploy your backend
railway init
railway up
```

## Testing the Fixed Deployment

After redeployment, test these endpoints:

```bash
# Health check (should work)
curl https://marico-insighting-tool-wkji.vercel.app/health

# API documentation (should work)
curl https://marico-insighting-tool-wkji.vercel.app/api

# File upload (will return error message)
curl -X POST https://marico-insighting-tool-wkji.vercel.app/api/files/upload
```

## Recommendation

**For Production Use:**
1. **Deploy Node.js backend to Railway** (supports file operations)
2. **Deploy Python backend to Railway/Render** (supports heavy processing)
3. **Keep frontend on Vercel** (excellent for React apps)

This gives you the best of all worlds:
- ✅ Vercel for frontend (fast, global CDN)
- ✅ Railway for backends (persistent storage, file operations)
- ✅ Proper separation of concerns

## Quick Railway Deployment

If you want to try Railway:

```bash
# In your project root
railway login
railway init
railway add
railway up
```

Railway will automatically detect your Node.js backend and deploy it with persistent file storage support.
